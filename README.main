#Decoding gps data (in ubx format) from u-blox reciever. Working with UBX format and extracted relevant navigation data for use in the planner


1)To decode we need to:-
*Read the binary stream from the u-blox receiver (usually via serial port or USB).
*Identify UBX messages by looking for sync chars (0xB5 0x62).
*Parse the payload according to message type. Examples:
*NAV-POSLLH : Latitude, Longitude, Height
*NAV-VELNED : Velocity North/East/Down, Speed, Heading
*NAV-TIMEUTC : GPS/UTC Time
*Convert raw values into human-readable units:
*After that we need to extract the relevant data like, position, current time, velocity, latitude etc..
*We need pass  this data is passed into the planner module of your system.This enables the planner to make navigation decisions.


2)Develop a path planning algorithm to traverse over a gridmap.
  *Explore all the cells layer by layer
  *Calculate all the possible distances from the starting point(including diagonally)
  *Or use the Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to find the lighest grids and calculate the shortest distance from start poitn

3): Generate odometry commands to guide the rover along the generated path.
Converted the path into motion commands (direction and timing) based on wheel parameters.
*Convert the data into low level commands
*Extract the directions from the low level commands
*Also simultaneously convert it into motion primitives like left,right etcc. for the respective directions
*Compute the wheel rotation/velocity using kinematics
